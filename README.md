Welcome to **SledBuild Remastered** or (SBR for short). This is a complete rework of the original SledBuild gamemode created by **G3X** back in 2010.

If you are here because you want to play the gamemode, you can subscribe to it on the steam workshop [**here**](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2867842930).

## Discord:
There is an official server for SBR on Discord, where I'd like to create a community for contributing and having fun. You can join it [**here**](https://discord.gg/tCVAAr3ZAU).

## About this project:
SBR was created because I think that this unique gamemode is very fun and interesting to let it die. I also felt like the original implementation was missing some crucial things that could have made the gamemode even better.

So this project aims to do the following key things:
- Implement the original SledBuild but with **more features**.
- Try to keep the gameplay as **competitive as possible**.
- Provide an **open source** base for people to contribute.
- Enable **mapping support** for a wide variety of maps.
- Bring back the fun!

## Wiki:
If you want to know more about the gamemode, you can check the [**wiki**](https://github.com/jotalanusse/sledbuild-remastered/wiki) for more information. Here you can find a lot of useful information such as: map creation, server configuration, contribution guidelines, etc.

## Development
SBR is being developed in my spare time, that means that I can't dedicate all my time to it. The development of this project may be slow, but I'll try to keep it as active as possible. You can track the current progress of the project in Notion [**here**](https://sled-build-remastered.notion.site/c87702d5c2184d668687e01fc166d550?v=77a44b0a04ab45a092b2b09872843b5f).

## Credit:
Although SBR is a **complete rework** of the original LUA code, at the beginning a lot of inspiration was taken on how this gamemode was coded (I didn’t know anything and needed a lot of reference). So it’s the right thing to acknowledge the **original contributors**:

- G3X [Coding and Development / Gamemode Concept]
- ReaperSWE [Coding and Development / HUD & GUI Development]
- Borsty [Coding and Development / Mapping]
- Pk191 [Music / SFX]
